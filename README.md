Effortless Infrastructure allows you to post your code to an API endpoint and it automatically creates all of the cloud infrastructure needed to run your code!

We use Jupyterlab to write our code but it works with any Python code. Next up on our roadmap is to support JS and typescript and to allow you to create Azure and GCP infrastructure in the same way you can create AWS infrastructure.
